Project Title: Starbucks Simulator
Group Members: Eric Claerhout, Henry Lin

Description:
Starbucks simulator is a terminal-based game where users are given a randomly
chosen name and are tasked with finding alternative spellings in a timed
environment, akin to the common misspellings of client names by Starbucks
baristas. The project will implement the Damerau-Levenshtien algorithm for
determining the edit distance between the original name and the user's input,
which will be used as the score. The twist, however, is that the user is
competing against a variety of phonetic indexing algorithms such as Soundex,
NYSIIS, or Metaphone. If the misspelled name does have the same phonetic index
as the original, there will be no points awarded. The style of the project will
draw from retro-style fighting games such as Street Fighter.

Beyond this base game, we hope to implement some simple ASCII art and multiple
datasets of names from various linguistic origin to keep the game interesting.


Milestones:
1. Create score class which implements Damerau-Levenshtien and CPU class which
   implements Soundex. Add basic input-output functionality to test the classes.
2. Add basic score-tracking logic and CSV parsing to make use of name datasets.
   Implement NYSIIS. The game should be playable, though unfinished in this
   stage.
3. Improve on user interaction, add timer functionality, moving to next name,
   implement Metaphone. The game should be fully playable at this stage, but may
   be lacking QoL features.
4. Finalize the user interaction and QoL features such as multiple rounds,
   user-selection of the opponent.

As time allows:
5. Implement more "opponents" such as Double Metaphone, Match-Rating
6. Improve on user interaction with simple, ASCII-based GUI
7. Implement multiple datasets, acting as the user's character select

Stretch Goals:
- Leaderboards
- Damerau-Levenshtien distance breakdown
